## How to use
- Replace the CSV file there as default with your own with identical set up with the number of the coordinate in the first column, x in the second column, and y in the third.
- To compile use `gcc main.c regression.c -o regression -lm` the `lm` flag ensures the math libraries are also compiled.
- To run `./regression` and you should see the `y = mx + b` form of the regression line. 

### Note
I used OpenAnalysis.org to get random points for testing
